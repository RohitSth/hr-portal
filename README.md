I'm using both Axios and TanStack Query together in the refactored code, and for good reason. They actually complement each other really well:
Axios is still handling the actual HTTP requests - it's responsible for:

Creating and sending the HTTP requests
Handling request/response interceptors
Managing authentication headers
Handling HTTP-specific error responses

TanStack Query, on the other hand, provides a layer on top that handles:

Caching of response data
Loading and error states (isPending, isError)
Automatic refetching
Optimistic updates
Request deduplication
Background fetching

Think of Axios as the low-level networking tool that actually makes the requests, while TanStack Query is the state management and caching layer that makes working with that data more efficient in a React application.
The key benefits of this combination:

Improved performance: TanStack Query caches responses, so repeated requests for the same data don't hit your server.
Better UX: Features like automatic background refreshing keep your data fresh without blocking the UI.
Reduced boilerplate: You no longer need to manually track loading/error states or implement retry logic.
Simplified data synchronization: Mutations (like login) can automatically invalidate related queries, keeping your UI in sync.

Here's a clear breakdown of responsibilities:
Axios
Use for:

Making HTTP requests to your API endpoints
Setting up request/response interceptors
Handling authentication headers
Configuring base URLs and default headers
Managing timeout settings and other HTTP-specific configurations

Example scenarios:

Creating a base API client
Setting up authorization headers
Handling 401 responses with token refresh logic

TanStack Query
Use for:

Data fetching with automatic caching
Managing loading/error states for API calls
Refetching data automatically (on window focus, network reconnect, etc.)
Optimistic updates when mutating data
Pagination and infinite scrolling
Managing server state

Example scenarios:

Fetching user profile data
Creating, updating, or deleting resources
Implementing search functionality with debounced queries
Loading data with dependencies (query A depends on query B)

Zustand
Use for:

Managing client-side application state
Storing UI state
Persisting authentication state
Sharing state between unrelated components
Managing global settings or preferences

Example scenarios:

Authentication state (is user logged in?)
Theme settings (dark/light mode)
UI state (is sidebar open?)
User preferences
Shopping cart state

Decision Framework

Is it server data that needs to be cached and synchronized?

Use TanStack Query with Axios as the fetcher

Is it client-only state that needs to be shared across components?

Use Zustand

Is it a one-time data submission that doesn't need to be cached?

Use Axios directly or TanStack Query's mutation without caching

Is it authentication state that persists across page refreshes?

Use Zustand with persistence middleware

Practical Example
User Authentication Flow:

Use Zustand to store: isAuthenticated, user, token (persisted to localStorage)
Use TanStack Query with Axios to handle: login/signup API calls, refreshing tokens
Use Axios interceptors to: add auth headers, handle 401 responses

User Profile Management:

Use TanStack Query to: fetch profile data, update profile
Use Zustand to: store user preferences
Use Axios to: make the actual HTTP requests

Performance Management Module:

Use TanStack Query to: fetch/update employee performance data
Use Zustand to: store filters, sorting preferences, current view mode
Use Axios to: communicate with your API

This separation of concerns will make your code more maintainable and efficient. TanStack Query handles all the complex caching and synchronization of server state, while Zustand manages the purely client-side application state.
